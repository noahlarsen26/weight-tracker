# Weight Tracking App

An application built with React, JavaScript, SCSS, and CSS, where after a user registers/logs in, the data that they have input is saved to a database and the app is able to track how close the user is to reaching their goals and displays the users weight and BMI. 

The app contains a [history](#history-page) page that displays the users previous weight inputs, as well as the date in which the weight was updated, and how much progress was made at the time.

The [profile](#profile-page) page allows the user to edit the information that is saved to their profile.

[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) is used as the database to store the users and the user properties.
